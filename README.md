## Problem Statement

Reliance SMART, like any large retail operation, generates substantial sales data. Effectively analyzing this data is crucial for:

*   Monitoring overall sales performance against targets.
*   Understanding product brand performance and identifying top performers.
*   Analyzing regional sales distribution and identifying key markets.
*   Tracking transaction volume across different states.
*   Identifying areas for improvement and optimizing sales strategies.

This dashboard aims to provide a clear and concise overview of key sales metrics to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

(This section needs details on the specific cleaning steps used. Some general examples include:)

*   **Data Validation:** Ensuring data consistency and accuracy (e.g., handling incorrect product codes or negative sales values).
*   **Data Aggregation:** Summarizing data at different levels (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly sales totals).
*   **Data Transformation:** Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue, profit, and return rates.

## Dashboard Development

The dashboard appears to be developed using a Business Intelligence tool (likely Power BI, Tableau, or similar). The development likely involved:

1.  **Data Connection:** Connecting to the data sources.
2.  **Data Modeling:** Creating relationships between different data tables.
3.  **Visualization Design:** Creating charts, graphs, and tables to represent the data.
4.  **Interactive Elements:** Implementing filters and potentially drill-down functionality.

## Key Metrics and Visualizations

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

    *   **Revenue vs. Previous Month:** 120.16K (Goal: 113.79K (+5.6%))
    *   **Profit vs. Previous Month:** 71.68K (Goal: 67.87K (+5.61%))
    *   **Return vs. Previous Month:** 496 (Goal: 563 (+11.9%))

*   **North America and Asia seem to be significant markets** in terms of revenue.
*   **Certain states (e.g., Yucatan, Veracruz) show higher transaction volumes.**

## Tools Used

*   **Data Visualization:** (Likely Power BI, Tableau, or similar)
*   (Add other tools used for data extraction, cleaning, etc.)
